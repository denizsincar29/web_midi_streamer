Note: The actual PNG icons need to be created manually or using an image editor.

For development/testing, the app will fall back to the favicon if icons are missing.

To create icons quickly, use one of these methods:

1. Online tool: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Use an SVG to PNG converter with the icon.svg file
3. Create with any graphics editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)

Required files:
- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)
